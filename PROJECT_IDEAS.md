PROJECT IDEAS
1. 
PROPOSED PF ___ Build a basic Kalshi-focused dashboard that automatically ingests relevant market data (from your HPC pipeline or a suitable data feed) and displays real-time or daily updates. Provide a brief verification artifact (e.g., a screenshot or link) demonstrating the dashboardâ€™s functionality and how it integrates with any HPC processes to track and visualize market positions. This aligns with your HPC-driven goals by offering an immediate, practical interface for spotting trading opportunities on Kalshi without duplicating any existing tasks. .. 900

VERIFICATION PROMPT ___ In your on-chain response, include a short description (under 1k characters) explaining how your Kalshi-focused dashboard is pulling data (from an HPC pipeline or another feed) and what key metrics it displays in real time. Provide a single link or hashed reference (e.g., a GitHub commit, screenshot URL, or on-chain hash) that a third party could check later. In your private verification document, paste a more detailed explanation of the dashboard setup, including any relevant HPC integration steps and usage instructions. Finally, if possible, briefly describe one real example of the dashboard identifying a specific market opportunity on Kalshi.

2. 
PROPOSED PF ___ Create an automated HPC-scheduled job that retrieves Kalshi market data multiple times a day, stores the data in a structured format, and updates your existing Kalshi dashboard with newly fetched metrics. Provide a brief console screenshot or link showing the HPC job configuration (e.g., a SLURM script or equivalent) and a screenshot or link to the updated dashboard displaying real-time changes. This ensures meaningful HPC integration with the Kalshi platform and yields a concrete proof of your enhanced pipeline. .. 900

VERIFICATION PROMPT ___ In your on-chain response, include a short unique identifier for your HPC job configuration (e.g., a commit hash or timestamp) and a brief description of how it runs daily. Provide a screenshot or snippet of your HPC scheduling script, plus a live link or reference showing updated Kalshi metrics in real time, in the verification section of your private document. If you can, also upload a console log excerpt that confirms the updates occurred at different times of day. That way, anyone revisiting this proof can confirm both the HPC job configuration and the data updates without overly compromising your privacy.
