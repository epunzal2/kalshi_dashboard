PROJECT IDEAS
1. 
PROPOSED PF ___ Build a basic Kalshi-focused dashboard that automatically ingests relevant market data (from your HPC pipeline or a suitable data feed) and displays real-time or daily updates. Provide a brief verification artifact (e.g., a screenshot or link) demonstrating the dashboard’s functionality and how it integrates with any HPC processes to track and visualize market positions. This aligns with your HPC-driven goals by offering an immediate, practical interface for spotting trading opportunities on Kalshi without duplicating any existing tasks. .. 900

VERIFICATION PROMPT ___ In your on-chain response, include a short description (under 1k characters) explaining how your Kalshi-focused dashboard is pulling data (from an HPC pipeline or another feed) and what key metrics it displays in real time. Provide a single link or hashed reference (e.g., a GitHub commit, screenshot URL, or on-chain hash) that a third party could check later. In your private verification document, paste a more detailed explanation of the dashboard setup, including any relevant HPC integration steps and usage instructions. Finally, if possible, briefly describe one real example of the dashboard identifying a specific market opportunity on Kalshi.

PROPOSED PF ___ Create an automated HPC-scheduled job that retrieves Kalshi market data multiple times a day, stores the data in a structured format, and updates your existing Kalshi dashboard with newly fetched metrics. Provide a brief console screenshot or link showing the HPC job configuration (e.g., a SLURM script or equivalent) and a screenshot or link to the updated dashboard displaying real-time changes. This ensures meaningful HPC integration with the Kalshi platform and yields a concrete proof of your enhanced pipeline. .. 900

VERIFICATION PROMPT ___ In your on-chain response, include a short unique identifier for your HPC job configuration (e.g., a commit hash or timestamp) and a brief description of how it runs daily. Provide a screenshot or snippet of your HPC scheduling script, plus a live link or reference showing updated Kalshi metrics in real time, in the verification section of your private document. If you can, also upload a console log excerpt that confirms the updates occurred at different times of day. That way, anyone revisiting this proof can confirm both the HPC job configuration and the data updates without overly compromising your privacy.

PROPOSED PF ___ Implement and finalize your Kalshi HTTP client to fetch real-time bid-ask spread, volume, and other key metrics from the Kalshi API, ensuring the data is reliably logged or stored for HPC-based analysis. Test the new API endpoints thoroughly, confirm successful data capture, and produce a short log or screenshot verifying the final integration. This directly advances your data-driven trading goals by capturing the most relevant Kalshi metrics in a verifiable manner. .. 900
VERIFICATION PROMPT ___ Please share a concise snippet (under 1k characters) of your finalized Kalshi HTTP client code, along with the timestamped log output showing successful real-time data capture in your on-chain response. Provide a brief statement indicating the specific Kalshi API endpoints you tested and the date/time of these tests. In your private verification document, paste more comprehensive logs or screenshots that confirm the captured metrics and their source. Finally, ensure that the data you submit can be referenced by a third party if needed.

PROPOSED PF ___ Develop a lightweight web-based or cloud-based dashboard that displays your newly fetched Kalshi market data in rich visual charts or tables. Verify the setup by sharing a screenshot or link showing the live dashboard and highlighting key metrics you find valuable (e.g., pricing trends, volume). This provides immediate, visual clarity on market shifts without replicating the HPC usage analytics done elsewhere, thereby strengthening your decision-making workflow for trading. .. 900
VERIFICATION PROMPT ___ In your on-chain response, provide a direct link to your working dashboard displaying real Kalshi market data, plus one key metric you find important (e.g., volume or pricing trend). In the verification section of your Google document, paste a screenshot or snippet that clearly shows the dashboard’s data feed and any unique naming convention you used. Ensure the link remains accessible so a third party could visit and confirm the data in real time. Keep your explanation under 1,000 characters and avoid sharing sensitive information.
