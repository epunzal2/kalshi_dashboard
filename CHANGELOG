Finalized and tested `src/clients.py::KalshiHttpClient`:
- Created test script `tests/test_kalshi_client_final.py` to exercise key V2 API endpoints.
- Tested endpoints using DEMO environment: `get_exchange_status`, `get_event`, `get_events` (by series), `get_market`, `get_market_orderbook`, `get_market_candlesticks`, `get_trades`. Test Date/Time: 2025-03-31T00:53:20Z.
- Confirmed successful real-time data capture (order book, trades, candlesticks).
- Generated detailed test logs and stored them in `tests/2025-03-29_23:49__HK47/test_run.log` for reference.
- Verified compatibility of `src/data_fetcher.py` with the updated client in `LOCAL_MODE`.
