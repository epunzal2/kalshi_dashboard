PROJECT IDEAS
1. 
PROPOSED PF ___ Build a basic Kalshi-focused dashboard that automatically ingests relevant market data (from your HPC pipeline or a suitable data feed) and displays real-time or daily updates. Provide a brief verification artifact (e.g., a screenshot or link) demonstrating the dashboard’s functionality and how it integrates with any HPC processes to track and visualize market positions. This aligns with your HPC-driven goals by offering an immediate, practical interface for spotting trading opportunities on Kalshi without duplicating any existing tasks. .. 900

VERIFICATION PROMPT ___ In your on-chain response, include a short description (under 1k characters) explaining how your Kalshi-focused dashboard is pulling data (from an HPC pipeline or another feed) and what key metrics it displays in real time. Provide a single link or hashed reference (e.g., a GitHub commit, screenshot URL, or on-chain hash) that a third party could check later. In your private verification document, paste a more detailed explanation of the dashboard setup, including any relevant HPC integration steps and usage instructions. Finally, if possible, briefly describe one real example of the dashboard identifying a specific market opportunity on Kalshi.
